*Task 1: Visualization of India’s Population Distribution by Age (2022)*   
As part of my internship at *SkillCraft Technology, I successfully completed Task 1, which involved analyzing and visualizing India’s population distribution by age groups for the year 2022. Using [Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) / Excel / Tableau / Other Tool], I created a **bar chart* to represent the demographic trends, highlighting key age brackets (e.g., 0–20, 21–64, 65+).
